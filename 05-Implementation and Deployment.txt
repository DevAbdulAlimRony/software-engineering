- Coding principals:
    1. Use a style guide, so all the code looks relatively the same
    2. Code is written for people, not computers.
    3. Make modules easy to learn and understand.
    4. Go into everything with a plan.
    5. Shorter Code != Better Code. Make it Readable.
    6. Break up actions into methods.

- Buy vs Build: Like using 3rd party package rather than building.

- Deployment: Deployment is a mix between testing and implementation. It happens after testing, but a lot of times requires certain implementation to get correct. The level of planning in this phase, directly relates to how the deployment effects the overall project.

- Deployment Planning: Amount of planning is dependant on the size of the change. We look at which areas will most likely have the biggest problems. Areas to look at-
    -Database Activities
    - 3rd Party Software Integration
    - Run time changes.
    - Training
    - Downtime
    - Backups
    - Network
    - Memory

- Deployment Rollback: Rollback is the act of reverting a system back to a previous working state.
