- Software Models need to construct a large scale software in an approach so that it can be maintainable and scalable. 

- Technical Debt: A poor, hard to understand 'hacky' implementation which will have to be repaid with interest later on. 20% of projects fail, many of those are due to poor development practices.

- Typical Software Development Cycle: Requirements(what we are building), Design(How), Implementation(build), Verification(Testing), Maintenance(Bugs, New Features, Rolled Back etc)
